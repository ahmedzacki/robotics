# Robotics Project

This project encompasses a series of developments in robotics control systems, utilizing a combination of sensors, actuators, and algorithms to achieve sophisticated robotic behaviors. The project is structured around several key functionalities including motor speed control, sensor integration, and dynamic interaction with the environment. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific aspect of robotic control, reflecting progressive enhancements and capabilities.

## Folders:
- `Final Code`: Contains the complete, integrated code combining all aspects of the robotics functionalities developed in previous labs.
- `Localization`: Focuses on robotic localization techniques using sensor data to determine the robot's position in a 2D space.
- `Locomotion & Manipulation`: Covers the fundamentals of robot movement and interaction with objects, including detailed motor and servo control.
- `PID Wall Follower`: Implements a PID controller for wall-following behavior, allowing the robot to navigate smoothly along the walls.
- `Robot Control (Servo Control with US Sensor)`: Utilizes a servo and ultrasonic sensor to perform tasks that require angular positioning.
